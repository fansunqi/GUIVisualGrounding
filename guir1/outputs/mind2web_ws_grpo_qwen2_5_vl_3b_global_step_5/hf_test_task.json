The current screen shows various products, but we need to focus on selecting the cheapest options that meet the requirements.\n\nFirst, let's identify the cheapest option available. The current screen displays several products, including keyboards, monitors, and other accessories. We should look for the cheapest item that fits our criteria.\n\nThe cheapest item visible is the \"Maxell Eb-95 Stereo Earbuds\" priced at $4.89. This seems like a good starting point since it is one of the cheapest items shown.\n\nNext, we need to ensure that the selected item meets the requirements of having a Windows 11 64-bit Intel i7 CPU, 256GB SSD, and 4GB RAM. Since the earbuds do not meet these specifications, we should move on to the next cheapest option.\n\nLet's select the \"Dell E1715S 17\" 1280x1024 LED-Backlit LCD Display Monitor\" priced at $59.99. This monitor does not meet the hardware requirements either, so we need to find another option.\n\nWe should now look for a keyboard or mouse that meets the hardware requirements. The \"Techware PBT Keycaps, Double-Shot PBT Keycap Set, for Mechanical Keyboards, Full 112 Keys Set, OEM Profile\" priced at $11.99 appears to be a suitable choice for a keyboard.\n\nLet's select this keyboard to proceed with building the entry-level PC.\n\nNow, we need to add the cheapest component and accessories available. The \"Techware PBT Keycaps, Double-Shot PBT Keycap Set, for Mechanical Keyboards, Full 112 Keys Set, OEM Profile\" is the cheapest keyboard available, which meets the hardware requirements.\n\nFinally, we need to add the cheapest monitor available. The \"Dell E1715S 17\" 1280x1024 LED-Backlit LCD Display Monitor\" is the cheapest monitor available, which also meets the hardware requirements.\n\nTherefore, the next step is to add the cheapest keyboard and monitor to the cart.\n\nAction: Click on the \"ADD ALL TO CART\" button to add the cheapest keyboard and monitor to the cart.\n\n</think> <answer>[{'action': 'click', 'point': [1195, 388]}, {'action': 'type', 'text': 'ADD ALL TO CART'}]</answer>", "gt_coord": {"height": 81.6875, "width": 124.0, "x": 448.0, "y": 16.890625}, "gt_op": {"op": "CLICK", "original_op": "CLICK", "value": ""}, "pred_coord": [1195, 388]}
