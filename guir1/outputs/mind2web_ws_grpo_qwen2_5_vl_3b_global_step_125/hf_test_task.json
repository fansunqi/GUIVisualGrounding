To proceed with finding a hotel, I need to navigate away from this page and look for a hotel booking website or app. Since there's no direct link to a hotel booking site, I should consider using a general search engine or a hotel booking platform like Booking.com or Expedia. However, since the task is to find a place to stay near the park, I will assume that the next step involves interacting with the current form to possibly submit it or proceed with the email subscription, but this is not directly related to booking a hotel. Therefore, I should focus on navigating away from this page to find a suitable hotel booking option.\n\n</think> \n<answer>[{'action': 'click', 'point': [567, 614], 'input_text': 'no input text'}]</answer>", "gt_coord": {"height": 54.828125, "width": 408.5, "x": 674.0, "y": 233.421875}, "gt_op": {"op": "CLICK", "original_op": "CLICK", "value": ""}, "pred_coord": [567, 614]}
